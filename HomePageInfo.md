Mission: To build a platform that makes academic excellence universally accessible.

Values:
- Excellence
    - SciWeb uses structured AI to provide the highest quality of support for students.
- Accessibility
    - SciWeb is a free, open-source, and community-driven platform that is accessible to all students.
- Discovery
    - SciWeb guides students to derive concepts from within their own knowledge, and to discover new connections between concepts.
    - SciWeb gives students agency over their own academic journey.
- Connection
    - SciWeb fosters community within academic circles and enables the seamless sharing of ideas and resources.

History:
    - SciWeb was founded in 2023 by 3 Bronx Science students who were frustrated with the lack of academic resources available to them, and saw potential for the use of AI to facilitate the discovery of new connections between concepts and promote a more personalized and engaging learning experience.
    - After 2 rejected club applications, 5 million lines of code, and 1000+ hours of development, SciWeb was finally launched in 2025 as a state-of-the-art academic platform.
    - SciWeb has almost 15 collaborators over 3 departments.
    - We've received many endorsements from students, faculty, and administrators.

Philosophy:
    - Over the past 2 years, our team of talented, bright minds engaged in rigorous introspection and we independently developed a theory of learning and organization similar to that pioneered by Joseph Novak and David Ausubel after 20+ years of research.
    - We believe that during the learning process, the brain organizes information into a hierarchy of interconnected concepts, and that this hierarchy is the key to understanding and retaining information.
    - We believe that the best way to learn is to derive concepts from within one's own knowledge given minimal external guidance.
    - We also represent the knowledge accrued by the student in a visual hierarchy, which we call a "concept map".
    - Since knowledge is only useful if it can be derived from other knowledge, we believe that given a small set of basis knowledge, one can unilaterally derive a huge amount of mathematics and physical sciences.


Innovations:
    - SciWeb exploits structured, decentralized AI to combine the accessibility of AI with the precision and organization of human instruction and guidance.
    - SciWeb plays into the motivational and reward structures of the human brain by linking everything t

1. Sign up page: keep as is but add cool animations, like have a "hello, name" button pop up as soon as they enter their name. Also get rid of the grade level option on the sign up page.
2. Email verification: make this actually work, but keep the same UI.
3. usertype page(MS/HS student, college/grad student, career professional)(keep as is), but once they select one, let them specify an institution, grade/year(as appropriate), and major/career(as appropriate).
4. (New page) SciWeb Motivations: Which goals do you want to pursue with SciWeb? Briefly contextualize these goals. How do you want to use SciWeb? Have a brief conversation with the AI to get to know the user and their goals.
5. (New page) SciWeb Experience page. Start with a cool looking loading animation, "while we personalize your SciWeb experience...". Then, in a cinematic way, explain how SciWeb works and how it can benefit the student in the context of their goals.
    - Use AI to take in their goals and preferences(specified in the previous page), along with how SciWeb works, and have it return cards with the best ways in which SciWeb can help them achieve their goals.
    - The purpose of SciWeb is to help the user to build a comprehensive and representative network of ideas, plans, and motivations, and to help them question, expand, and improve it in service of their goals.
    - Also present some additional features(Grade Analysis, Shared Motivations feed, classes page, etc.) that may be of interest to the user.
6. (New page) SciWeb Customization: Using the user's goals and motivations, we will customize SciWeb to their needs.
    - Soptlight the nodes that are most relevant to the user's goals and motivations, but let them choose any combination of nodes they want.
    - For each node type, let them choose the color, shape, icon, and font.
    - Also let them choose from a menu of node-specific features, all of which allow them to harness AI to expand and question their ideas, plans, and motivations.
    - For those node types that have their own page or settings associated with them(class, motivation, essay, project, learning objective, and problem type), if they select one of these, familiarize them with the page and its features.
7. Jupiter Page: in the info section of the page, introduce the user to some of the grade analysis features available to them on the grade analysis page. Keep the functionality as is.
8. Classes page: keep as is.
9. Get rid of counselor page. This functionality will go in the Customization page.
